23. Student Database Management using Shell Script
As this is a shell scripting task, hereâ€™s a simple Bash script that performs basic operations on a student database, including insertion, deletion, update, and search.
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

DATABASE="students.txt"

insert_student() {
    echo -n "Enter student ID: "
    read id
    echo -n "Enter student name: "
    read name
    echo -n "Enter student grade: "
    read grade
    echo "$id $name $grade" >> $DATABASE
    echo "Student added."
}

delete_student() {
    echo -n "Enter student ID to delete: "
    read id
    grep -v "^$id " $DATABASE > temp.txt && mv temp.txt $DATABASE
    echo "Student deleted."
}

update_student() {
    echo -n "Enter student ID to update: "
    read id
    grep -v "^$id " $DATABASE > temp.txt
    echo -n "Enter new name: "
    read name
    echo -n "Enter new grade: "
    read grade
    echo "$id $name $grade" >> temp.txt
    mv temp.txt $DATABASE
    echo "Student updated."
}

search_student() {
    echo -n "Enter student ID to search: "
    read id
    grep "^$id " $DATABASE
}

while true; do
    echo "1. Insert Student"
    echo "2. Delete Student"
    echo "3. Update Student"
    echo "4. Search Student"
    echo "5. Exit"
    read -p "Choose an option: " option

    case $option in
        1) insert_student ;;
        2) delete_student ;;
        3) update_student ;;
        4) search_student ;;
        5) break ;;
        *) echo "Invalid option" ;;
    esac
done
